    The anisotropic magnetic Peltier effect (AMPE), first demonstrated by our center [K. Uchida <i>et al.</i>, Nature (2018)], is an interesting thermoelectric effect where the Peltier coefficient depends on the relative angle between magnetization and current in a magnetic material. Experimental results show that there is a remarkable material dependence of this phenomenon, with anisotropic magnetic Peltier coefficients being particularly large for Ni and Ni-containing alloys. We have discussed the <font color="red"><b>origins of the material dependence</b></font> by first-principles analysis and proposed that the characteristic band structure of Ni is the key to the enhancement of the anisotropic magnetic Peltier coefficient.
