        Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) have a structure in which an insulator is sandwiched between ferromagnetic materials and are used in various magnetic sensors and next-generation nonvolatile memories. Theoretical proposal of novel MTJs with better properties is one of our important research themes. Recently, we have studied (111) oriented MTJs [Figure (b)], which have a different structure from conventional (001) oriented MTJs [Figure (a)], and found that a very large magnetoresistance ratio can be obtained {% cite Masuda2020-vh Masuda2021-tg %}. We have also found that this giant magnetoresistance ratio is caused by a new mechanism called <font color="red"><b>interfacial resonance tunneling</b></font>. Further experimental and theoretical studies on such novel (111) oriented MTJs are expected in the future.
