      The atomic nuclei that make up materials are not stationary in space, but fluctuate thermally or quantum. These fluctuations are known to affect the stability and electronic states of materials. In this research, <font color="red"><b>we aim at quantitative prediction of nuclear fluctuation effects in magnetic materials</b></font>, and are developing a new method using first-principles phonon calculations and performing applied calculations. Recently, we have performed comprehensive phonon calculations for binary alloys composed of rare earths and iron, and analyzed phonon effects on phase stability. We found that phonon entropy has the effect of stabilizing many metastable phases at finite temperatures {% cite Xing2021-ql %}. We are also interested in the effects of spin-phonon coupling on magnetism, including magnetic moments, exchange coupling, and crystal magnetic anisotropy at finite temperatures, and are conducting fundamental research including method development. {% cite Xing2022-iv %}
