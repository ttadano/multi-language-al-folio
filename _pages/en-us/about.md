We conduct theoretical studies on magnetism, spin conduction, and heat transport in order to efficiently develop magnetic and spintronic materials and devices composed of these materials. We analyze electronic states, electrical conduction, and lattice vibrations of materials mainly by using first-principles calculations, with the aim of providing guidelines for realizing more functional magnetic materials. In particular, we focus on theoretically clarifying the magnetic properties of magnetic materials at the temperature at which they actually operate (around room temperature) by incorporating the effects of magnetization fluctuations and lattice dynamics at finite temperatures. More recently, we have also incorporated material informatics methods to explore magnetic materials more efficiently on a larger scale.
